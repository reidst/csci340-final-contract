# CSCI 340 Final Contract
The team contract for the CSCI 340 iSeeGreen Plant Identification final project

## Team structure
Our team of three people will meet every Friday at 1:00pm in the Snoddy Center, with additional meetings as necessary, making leadership and executive decisions by unanimous vote. Kate will lead communication with the client and other entities outside our group; Fin will create and manage documentation of our meetings and work; and Simon will assess and organize project work each week to ensure a proper working pace. We will communicate with each other via the Microsoft Team created for the project

## Team meeting procedure
If 2 out of 3 team members can't meet at the designated time, the meeting will be cancelled. If only 1 team member can't meet, they will be filled in later. Fin will post meeting notes to the teams. Attendance will be noted for each meeting. 

## Team participation
To ensure cooperation, equal distribution of tasks, and a proper pace, we will set goals at our weekly meetings and hold each other to them. For team maintenance, we will be sure to run our ideas by each other, to keep everyone informed. 

## Consequences
All breaches of contract will be recorded and reported in the peer evaluation at the end of the semester, and any other actions that need to be taken will be discussed as needed.

## Team responsibilities

Kate:

I have agreed to manage client communication as well as Front-end HTML/CSS. Regarding client communication, I will be the one to contact the client and organize meetings with them. I will also lead the development of our presentations to the class. Additionally, I will be the point person on HTML/CSS, but will not be the only one to work on it. I hope to contribute to a positive team experience by communicating early and often, and doing my best to meet whatever goals we set on time. In the case of conflicts, I plan to try first to talk it out and compromise, before reaching out to Dr. Goadrich.

Simon:

I have agreed to be the project manager specializing in SQL schema design and framework/deployment matters. As project manager, I will lead team meetings, ensure everyone is coordinated in their work, and help redistribute work if one person experiences difficulty. As a team, we have decided that SQL schema design will be a team decision, but it will be my job to confirm our decisions as final. I hope to contribute to a positive team experience by listening to and respecting each team member's needs and opinions, ensuring everyone has an equal voice, and doing my best to redistribute our workloads according to each team member's needs.

Fin:

I have agreed to make records of all the work we do in an easy-to-read manner so that we can all look back on it whenever we need to. I have also agreed to manage the Front-end Javascript/AJAX. I plan to make records of meetings in separate documents and add them to the teams' files tab as a  PDF after fixing the readability of the document. To make sure that they stay organized, the titles of each file will be in a YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE format, which will make sure that the files will be in chronological order. I hope to contribute to the team by making sure that miscommunication remains at a minimum at all times, which will help us reach our goals on time.
